The Guessing Game
========

In this game, you are asked to guess a randomly-chosen number from 1 to 100 in 7 guesses. When you make a guess, the program tells the user if the guess was too high, too low, or correct. If the user tries to input a value other than an integer from 1 to 100, the program displays a message saying that it is not a valid input and does not decrease the number of guesses remaining. If the user runs out of guesses, it will not accept any more input.
