The Guessing Game
========

In this game, you are asked to guess a randomly-chosen number from 1 to 100 in 7 guesses. When you make a guess, the program tells the user if the guess was too high, too low, or correct. If the user tries to input a value other than an integer from 1 to 100, the program displays a message saying that it is not a valid input and does not decrease the number of guesses remaining. It also logs all previous guesses and whether they were high, low, or correct, up to 17 at a time, underneath the text input. If the user runs out of guesses, the button text will change to "Reset" and if it is pressed, the game will reset all values and prompt the user to start again. 

The win and loss totals are tallied and displayed in the bottom corners. There are 4 difficulty buttons in the top left corner of the screen. When they are clicked, they reset the game, choosing a new answer in a range that is different depending on the difficulty chosen, and changing the number of guesses to be appropriate for the difficulty chosen.
